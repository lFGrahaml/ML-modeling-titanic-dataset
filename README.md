        Uni-Bivariate-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
        <ul>
          <li>
            explores the Titanic dataset through univariate and bivariate exploratory data analysis (EDA). I first categorize the variables based on their types (continuous or categorical) and then conduct appropriate descriptive analysis and visualizations. Also, identifies potential data issues (i.e outliers, skews, missing values, etc...).

          <li>
            includes two models.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Builds a logistic regression model to predict the probability of survival and evaluates with classification metrics.
